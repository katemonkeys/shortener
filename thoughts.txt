My url ended up being localhost:9393 not 4567....?


The first thing I want to do is figure out the shortening function. Wasn't it just running the given URL through a SHA and taking the first five characters? Where is that? When I POST things through form.erb I get an empty string instead of a URL.

When I try and create a table in my migration it says error, can't find table....but I am creating it??
